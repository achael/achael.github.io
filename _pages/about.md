I am a [NASA Hubble Fellowship Program (NHFP)](http://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/fellowships/nasa-hubble-fellowship-program) [Einstein Fellow](http://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/fellowships/nasa-hubble-fellowship-program/meet-the-fellows) at the Princeton University [Center for Theoretical Science](http://pcts.princeton.edu/). I am a member of the [Event Horizon Telescope](http://eventhorizontelescope.org/) (EHT) collaboration.

I study the extreme environment just outside the event horizons of supermassive black holes, particularly in the galactic center <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*">Sgr A*</a> and [M87](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_87). I use supercomputer [simulations](/_pages/simulating) to study the flow of plasma as it falls into the black hole and is launched outward in relativistic jets. I also develop new approaches for testing theoretical predictions with new methods of [imaging](/_pages/imaging) these black holes with the EHT.  

<!--
I am a graduate student in theoretical and computational astrophysics with the [Event Horizon Telescope](http://eventhorizontelescope.org/) and a candidate for a Ph.D. in the Physics department at Harvard University. I work at the [Black Hole Initiative](https://bhi.fas.harvard.edu/).

My research uses new cutting-edge approaches for [simulating](/_pages/simulating) and [imaging](/_pages/imaging) the EHT's black hole targets <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*">Sgr A*</a> and [M87](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_87). My primary graduate adviser is [Ramesh Narayan](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~narayan/), and I am also advised by [Shep Doeleman](https://astronomy.fas.harvard.edu/people/shep-doeleman) and [Michael Johnson](http://www.scintillatingastronomy.com/).

I grew up in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I received a BA in Physics with a secondary concentration in Medieval studies from [Carleton College](https://www.carleton.edu/) in 2013, and I earned a Ph.D. in Physics from Harvard University in 2019. At Harvard, I worked at the [Black Hole Initiative](https://bhi.fas.harvard.edu/); I was advised by [Ramesh Narayan](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~narayan/), [Shep Doeleman](https://astronomy.fas.harvard.edu/people/shep-doeleman) and [Michael Johnson](http://www.scintillatingastronomy.com/).

#I also serve as a [Resident Tutor](https://dunster.harvard.edu/resident-tutors/) at [Dunster House](https://dunster.harvard.edu) in Harvard College, where I mentor and advise undergraduates on national fellowship applications, LGBTQ life, physics and astronomy courses, and paths to graduate school.

I am a proud member of the Astronomy and Astrophysics [Outlist](https://astro-outlist.github.io/) of LGBTQIA+ members of the astronomical community.
