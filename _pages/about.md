I am a fellow at the Princeton University [Gravity Initiative](https://gravity.princeton.edu/). From 2019-2022 I was a [NASA Hubble Fellowship Program](http://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/fellowships/nasa-hubble-fellowship-program) (NHFP) [Einstein Fellow](https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/fellowships/nasa-hubble-fellowship-program/2019-nhfp-fellows) at the Princeton [Center for Theoretical Science](http://pcts.princeton.edu/). I am a member of the [Event Horizon Telescope](http://eventhorizontelescope.org/) (EHT) collaboration.

I study the extreme environments just outside the event horizons of supermassive black holes, particularly in the galactic center <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*">Sgr A*</a> and [M87](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_87). I use analytic theory and supercomputer [simulations](/_pages/simulating) to study the flow of plasma as it falls into the black hole and is launched outward in relativistic jets. I also develop new approaches for testing theoretical predictions with new methods of [imaging](/_pages/imaging) these black holes with the EHT.  

I grew up in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I received a BA in Physics with a secondary concentration in Medieval studies from [Carleton College](https://www.carleton.edu/) in 2013, and I earned a Ph.D. in Physics from Harvard University in 2019. At Harvard, I worked at the [Black Hole Initiative](https://bhi.fas.harvard.edu/); I was advised by Prof. [Ramesh Narayan](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~narayan/).


I am a proud member of the Astronomy and Astrophysics [Outlist](https://astro-outlist.github.io/) of LGBTQIA+ members of the astronomical community.
